# Rock-vs-Mine-Predictor

# 🚨 Sonar-Based Rock vs. Mine Classifier 🚤⛏️

## Overview 📜

Ever wondered if you could predict whether an object beneath the riverbed is a mine or simply a rock using sonar signals? This project uses **Python** and **Linear Regression** to classify sonar data, identifying whether the object detected is a **Mine (1)** or a **Rock (0)**. 🪨💣

The current model is a **Linear Regression** classifier, but we’re working towards upgrading it to a more robust and precise **Random Forest** model. Stay tuned for even more accurate results! 🌲⚡

## Problem Statement 💡

Detecting whether sonar signals reflect off a **mine** or a **rock** is critical for marine safety, resource exploration, and environmental monitoring. This project uses sonar data with **60 frequency features** to make this determination. The goal is to develop a machine learning model capable of analyzing these features and predicting whether the object detected is a hazardous mine or a harmless rock under the water.

## Dataset 📊

The dataset consists of sonar signals with **60 features** captured from objects submerged in a riverbed. Each row in the dataset represents a sonar return, and the target variable indicates whether the object is a rock (0) or a mine (1).

### Sample Features:
- **60 frequency values** (amplitude of the sonar return at various frequencies)
- **Target Variable**: `Rock` (0) or `Mine` (1)

## Current Approach 🧠

Currently, we are using a **Linear Regression** model to classify the sonar signals. While Linear Regression provides us with a foundation for prediction, it may not be the most effective method for this classification task due to its simplicity and sensitivity to outliers.

### Tech Stack 🛠️:
- **Python**: Core programming language for the project.
- **Pickle**: For model serialization.
- **Pandas, Numpy**: Data manipulation and processing libraries.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for model building and evaluation.
- **Flask**: Simple web framework to deploy the model.

## Future Improvements 🚀

We aim to upgrade the model to a **Random Forest Classifier**, a more powerful and flexible machine learning model that can handle the complexity of the dataset better by:
- **Improved Accuracy**: A Random Forest model aggregates the predictions from multiple decision trees, reducing variance and increasing model stability.
- **Handling Non-linearity**: The sonar signal data is likely to have non-linear relationships between features, which Random Forest can capture better than Linear Regression.
  
This upgrade will bring:
- **More reliable predictions** 🌟
- **Faster computations** ⚡
- **Enhanced accuracy in edge cases** 🧠

## Installation and Usage 🖥️
